[Live version](https://nicolaslynch.github.io/weather-app/)




## Install dependencies:

- Remember to have React installed

- react-router-dom@5.3.0  
(It is necessary that this version be used. Because updates from version 6.0.0 onwards generate incompatibility)





## APIs:

- https://openweathermap.org/current
- https://openweathermap.org/forecast5




## Recommendations:

It is recommended to create an account on [official page](https://openweathermap.org/) page of these APIs to receive a "API key" to access these. Then change my "API key" to yours

Doing this is important because it is possible that in the future my "Api key" will be deleted.
